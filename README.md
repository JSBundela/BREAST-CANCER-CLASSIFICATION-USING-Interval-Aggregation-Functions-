Developing Prediction Intervals for Artificial Neural Networks Using Interval Aggregation Functions 

• Improve the reliability of deep neural networks in classification tasks by integrating uncertainty through prediction intervals, using
interval aggregation functions to capture and reflect prediction uncertainties.
• Developed an Ensemble artificial neural network model and implemented interval aggregation functions to create prediction
intervals. This approach enhances the network's ability to quantify uncertainty in its predictions.
• Achieved higher accuracy of 0.9912,Precision of 0.9913,Recall of 0.9912,F1 Score: 0.9912, demonstrating the effectiveness of
incorporating prediction intervals into the classification process for improved performance and reliability
